# Polycom-Configs

Polycom configuration files for SoundPoint IP, SoundStation IP, VVX and CCX phones. These can be used with Genesys Cloud CX and Genesys PureConnect to expand on the configuration options exposed by those platforms for managed IP phones. Refer to the documentation for your platform to understand how to apply custom configuration files. Refer to Polycom's documentation for the full set of configuration options available. These configuration files are not provided, supported or endorsed by Genesys or Polycom.

## httpEnabled.xml

Enables HTTP access to the phone's web interface. By default HTTPS is required and HTTP is disabled.

## screenCapture320.xml

Enables the screen capture feature.

## screenCapture580.xml

Enables the screen capture feature.

## vvxD60.xml

Configures the VVX D60 cordless phone paired to a VVX desk phone. Or at least it will once I figure that configuration out. Buy me a D60 if you want this configuration sooner rather than later.

## webConfigurationDisabled.xml

Disables access to configure the phone via the built-in web server.

## webServerDisabled.xml

Disables the phone's built-in web server.
